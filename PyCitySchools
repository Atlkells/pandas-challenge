PyCity Schools Analysis
Two observable trends, based on the data:

Overall, smaller and medium sized schools out-performed large sized schools when comparing passing math scores (98-91% versus 67%).

Generally speaking, if a school had a higher budget, it did not necessarily yield better test results. By comparison, schools with higher spending per student ($645-675) typically underperformed when compared to schools with smaller budgets (less than %585 per student).
